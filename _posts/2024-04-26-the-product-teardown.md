The concept of the product teardown comes from the electronics industry where practitioners disassembled physical products into their component parts in order to learn, among other things, how the parts contribute to the whole.  But the creation of software, as the manifestation of logic, is more abstract.  While a software product is often made up of component parts, the idea of taking this type of product apart is more metaphor than practice, especially for the product manager, who is less concerned with the inner workings of things than the user experience.
 
For this purpose, the product experience is best experienced.  In other words, the best way to evaluate a product is to use it.  When using the product, take the entire user lifecycle into account from onboarding to active usage and include pricing and measures of value, for example:
 
	- Onboarding - were you quickly able to starting using the product?  did you experience any friction or distractions?
	- Features - are all expected features included and do they complement each other?  are there gaps and inconsistencies?
	- Support - Is the application intuitive?  Did you rely on help or documentation?
	- Enablement - Does the application make you better?  Are productivity features included?
	- Value - Is the pricing competitive?  Is the value worth the cost?
 
In evaluating the product, imagination is required, for example it may be that some product features cannot be used by a single user or are not able to demonstrate value at low volumes, for example a search feature when there is little data to search.  Enterprise products and features may be difficult or impossible to evaluate when the user is not in a large organization.  In some cases, the product manager may not have access to the product at all.  Sometimes even product pricing is difficult to determine:  It may not be publicly available or based on usage and tiers.
 
A secondary approach when the user experience and other information is not available is to rely sole on reviews.  Product descriptions can be used to learn about the problem that the software solves and user reviews can reveal how well the product solves the problem.  The onboarding experience, features, and the rest may be revealed through user reviews as well.  Be wary of articles and white papers, these are often promotions or sponsored, and while they provide product and market information, it would not be an objective view.  Everything product is profit.
 
The product teardown can be applied to competitor products, vendor products, or even your own products.  As opposed to the product teardown done in other industries, to get to the internals of a product, the software product teardown can lead to ideas and opportunities for future work.
