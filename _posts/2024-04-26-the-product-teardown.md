title: The product teardown

The concept of the product teardown comes from the electronics industry where practitioners disassembled physical products into their component parts in order to learn, among other things, how the parts contribute to the whole.  But the creation of software, as the manifestation of logic, is more abstract.  While a software product is often made up of component parts, the idea of taking this type of product apart is more metaphor than practice, especially for the product manager, who is less concerned with the inner workings of things than the experience of the user.
 
For this purpose, the product experience is best experienced.  In other words, the best way to evaluate a product is to use it.  When using the product, take the entire user lifecycle into account from onboarding to active usage, along with pricing and measures of value.  Some questions to ask might include:
 
* Onboarding - Are you quickly able to use the product?  Did you experience any friction or distractions?
* Features - Are all expected features included? Do they complement one another?  Are there any gaps or inconsistencies?
* Support - Is the application intuitive?  What support is available?  Is documentation easy to follow?  Is it easy to get help?
* Enablement - Are productivity features included?  Does the application solve a specific problem?  Does it make you better?
* Value - Is the pricing competitive?  Are there alternatives?  Is the value worth the cost?
 
What if you do not have time to perform a through product teardown (I confess to being short on time often) or you do not have access to the product?  For these cases, I rely on ChatGPT, demo videos, product documentation, ratings and reviews.  These short-cuts can be effective for gathering material for a design session:  You can quickly learn how competing and related products have solved a problem that you face.  I often use ChatGPT to learn terms:  As an example, I may know that I need to manage images or track citations, but I may not know that there are products called "digital asset managers" and "reference managers" that are used for these purposes.  Demo videos and product documentation can be leveraged to learn how a product solves a problem, ratings and reviews can be used to find out if the product solves the problem well.
 
Given the reality of the workplace, the rush to market for startups, the divisions of product responsibilities in mature organizations, a quick product teardown is a practical approach that can be applied to competitor products, partner products, even your own products.  And while it may not be necessary to physically take a product apart, this mental exercise can be a great tool for solving problems, identifying gaps, and generating ideas for your next great discovery.  After all, innovation is not an accident nor unprovoked occurance, it is the result of daily practice, it is what we do.
