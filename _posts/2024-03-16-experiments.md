A small book can contain all the rules, the applications of which, are infinite.  This is true for English composition, it is true for product management.  If I were to write this book, it would start with the experiment.

Strictly speaking, the experiment is used to quantify the probability of a hypothesis.  The alternative hypothesis is the unknown, it is what you want to prove, and the null hypothesis is what you know.  

The process is thus:  The hypothesis is formed, the subjects selected, the data defined, the threshold determined, the experiment run.  

Once the experiment is done, the probability can be used to make an informed decision on what to do next.  This may take days, it may take years.  

But I ain't got time for that.

I am asked to create a portal, a platform or a content management system, and I am behind schedule.  I am compelled to get to work, without a problem to solve or a vision to achieve.

This is the starting point for a certain type of experiment:  The dumb question.

When everyone in the room is brilliant, this can feel like the difficult path and yet can be the least expensive way to start.  The goal is to discover the problem and, no matter the phrasing, the question is always "Why?"

Sometimes this question is best backed into:  Draw a picture and ask "Is this what you mean?"  The picture is not important; sometimes it is productive to present the wrong answer, this can serve as a trigger for discovery.

When the question "why" is asked with genuine curiosity and a desire to learn, great discoveries can be made.  The path to a truly groundbreaking product can include dead-ends and U-turns, roundabouts and slow zones, and sometimes looking around leads to the destination.

There are endless anecdotes of inexpensive experiments:  Presentation with no function, paper in place of code, manual effort rather than systemic process, and all are asking the same question:  Why am I doing this?

At this time, in this place, with these developments, like never before, this is existential.
