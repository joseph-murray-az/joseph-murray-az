What are the similarities between a product manager and a founder?  There are many good articles written by founders for founders that contain practices adopted by product managers:  Practices such as striving for product-market fit, seeking cost-effective solutions, and engaging in ruthless prioritization for example.  But while the role of founder may encompass the role of product manager, the opposite is not true, founders generally tread deeper water.  Nonetheless, there is overlap in the traits of both, the most important of which, is the ability to be relentlessly resourceful.

**Key for product managers**

What does it mean to be relentlessly resourceful?  The quality as defined for founders can be paraphrased as:

> The ability to consistently and creatively overcome obstacles, adapt to new challenges with flexibility and persistence, find innovative solutions to achieve goals, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments like startups.<sup>1</sup>

This quality for founders of startups is also well suited to product managers, not just in startups, but in other environments as well.

**Large companies provide opportunities to hone resourcefulness**

I worked as a consultant for several years for a large financial institution.  My company was hired because, while employees spent most of their time in meetings or dealing with crises, our teams produced software and released products.  During this time, as a team lead, I often ran into obstacles working across silos, teams, and managers.  One thing I learned was, when one manager would tell me "no," I would move up the hierarchy to get to "yes."  Unfortunately this is not an isolated example, corporate politics are common in large organizations:  By definition, bureaucracies move slowly and carefully, often for good reason, other times due to overbearing procedures, gatekeepers, and complex communication structures.  Working in such an environment, you learn that there are times when the results justify the act, and times when they don't; times when you should be subordinate, and times when you should be defiant; times when practicing transparency is essential, and times when moving quickly in the dark is necessary.  There are an infinite variety of approaches to solving blocks, by going over, beneath, or around an obstacle, that require flexibility and persistence by those with the desire to produce results.

**Small companies require resourcefulness**

In startups and small companies, the experience is more like a high-wire act—you need to maintain your footing even if the lights go out.  Despite their size, small companies can have internal obstacles created by the same silos and politics found in larger organizations. Additionally, there may be external obstacles due to limited resources, or caused by dependencies on vendors, partners, and investors.  In these cases, while there may be more freedom to make decisions with less oversight, the outcome of each decision can be more apparent, especially when the company’s success depends on these decisions. This is when a product manager is closer to the role of a founder and, due to the breadth and depth of the challenges, the product manage is required to exhibit creativity, flexibility, and persistence.  If being relentlessly resourceful is not an inherent trait, or already developed with time and experience, in this type of environment, success may be elusive. 

**Inherent or learned**

Although the quality of being relentlessly resourceful can be learned, it is more akin to a characteristic rather than a skill for which specific training exists.  Instead, whether developed or exposed, it is situational, enabled by the obstacle, manifest in the approach.  Although product managers are individual contributors, in theory less focused on appearances than outcomes, we are still affected by our environments, and all environments come with their challenges.  It is these challenges that define us; it is these challenges which we are able to overcome by being relentlessly resourceful.
