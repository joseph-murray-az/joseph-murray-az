title: Problem definition  
---

If the most expensive defect in software code comes from a poor requirement, then it follows that the most expensive defect in a software product comes from poor problem definition.  This can also be expressed as missing the market.

It is extremely difficult to clearly define a problem and it often takes many iterations to test hypotheses and remove false assumptions.  One approach that we often take, because we are busy, is to start out vague with the hope that we can work our way towards clarity.

But time spent on problem definition is time well spent, and is often the key to product success.  It may even turn out, due to a false assumption or hearsay, that there is no problem after all: Better to find out during discovery than when engineering teams are engaged.

And while the goal is for epics to succeed, not all epics do succeed, or at least not always the first time.  However, by clearly defining the problem, and having concrete measures of success, you can tell when your epic has failed.

The decision at this point is to go back to discovery to determine what was missed, or to move on.  And the ability to make this decision can be considered a success.

Maxim:  A clear definition of the problem leads the way for success.
