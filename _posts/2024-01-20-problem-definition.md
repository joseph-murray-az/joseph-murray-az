title: Problem definition  
---

If the most expensive defect in software code comes from a poor requirement, then it follows that the most expensive defect in a software product comes from poor problem definition.  This can also be expressed as missing the market.

It is extremely difficult to clearly define a problem and it often takes many iterations to test hypotheses and remove false assumptions.  One approach that we often take, because we are busy, it to start out vague with the hope that we can work our way towards clarity.

Time spent in seeking to clearly define the problem to be solved can result in a successful product or feature.  It may turn out, due to false assumptions or hearsay, that there is no problem after all.

And while the goal is for epics to succeed, not all epics do succeed, or at least not always the first time.  However, by clearly defining the problem, and having concrete measures of success, you can tell when your epic has failed.

The decision at this point is to go back to discovery to determine what was missed, or to move on.  And the ability to make this decision can be considered a success.

Maxim:  A clear definition of the problem leads the way for success.
