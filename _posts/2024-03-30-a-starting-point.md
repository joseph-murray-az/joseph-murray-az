title: A starting point

You may be asked to create a product brief for a problem that has not been articulated.  We often describe solutions when we think we are describing an obstacle.  Our customers are subject to this behavior as well:  They are unreliable narrators.  To make matters worse, there are deadlines and, like the trains in Tokyo Station, the doors are closing and the train is going to leave the platform, whether you are ready or not.  But even in this case, a product brief is like any other writing project, it is a tool for discovery and often you just need a way to start.

An effective technique for getting started is to play word association.  You start by writing the first word that comes to mind, then attempting to write an associated word, and continuing this process with subsequent associated words until your allotted time is up.  The purpose is to warm-up your brain, to activate the neural pathways, and to reveal the portion of your unconscious mind that is so effective at solving problems. 

As a technologist, your first instinct might be to use a computer:  Perhaps a document or mind mapping software would make this easier.  But there is something about the physical act of writing that feels more engaging and produces better results.  In addition, using paper and pencil, or whiteboard and marker, allows you to expand your vocabulary to use sketches, doodles, or other representations that can allow you to easily and quickly express a thought.  (By shutting off your computer, you are also less likely to be distracted by the email and messages that occur throughout the day).

Another technique is to explore the definition, context, or etymology of a word.  In software, it may be difficult to get to the root of a problem when it is obscured by unfamiliar words.  Every field has its language, shortcuts and acronyms, and even familiar words can have foreign definitions that depend on context.  (For example, the term "tensor" used in computer science to describe a multidimensional array of matrices means something different when used in both math and physics.)  Although the approach may be different, the exploration of the meaning of words is another form of word association.

These exercises might be throwaways once you get started on your first draft, although there can be profit in grouping like words that can be used to create your sentences and paragraphs.  You can also use these words to construct a prompt.  As an example, after playing word association for writing this post, I asked ChatGPT to write a paragraph using the words from my list (represented below in quotes):

> Using word association to generate a list of words is a creative technique that can spark inspiration and facilitate brainstorming. By starting with words like "word," "text," and "paragraph," one can quickly expand the list by associating related terms such as "organize," "group," "classify," "express," "process," and "generate."  Grouping these words according to topic enables a more organized approach to writing.

This is right thought, right effort, right action, and failure does not exist.
