title: Immerse yourself in tech
---

Good product managers immerse themselves in technology and are able to bring a variety of points into product discussions, they know what they like about different user experiences, they recognize common patterns, and they can speak product.  These skills are particularly useful for communicating with designers, moderating design discussions, and creating "delighters" that are fun to demo, to announce, to release.

But I can't help thinking there is more.

When I first started my career soon after my undergraduate studies, I had a manager say to me:  "Our job is not to give our customers what they ask for, it is to convince our customers that what we gave them is what they really wanted."

This was not what I was taught.

Later, I was in charge of a product that had a known defect, our engineers knew it was a defect, and so did I.  So I made the obvious decision to fix the glitch.  And that was a mistake.  Our users were furious.

They had learned how to work around the defect, they documented the steps, and the ability to fly through this flawed process was the sign of a super user.  They adapted because the software was useful.

The UI was ugly.  The navigation clunky.  The colors washed out and were reminiscent of times past.  But what did this software do?  It modeled two years of grocery store product data, every point of sale transaction that occurred every day for every product in every store across the country, and used these models to forecast unit sales for a given price.  

During this period, I heard the CEO of one of the largest US grocery chains talk about our software as he described the "science of forecasting" during an analyst call.  The segment was about the power of predictive analytics to get every price right, every time.  This talk was motivating for our users and especially motivating for us.

I later learned that this store chain was comprised of acquisitions, and each acquisition brought with it different disparate systems that did not fit together.  With our software, product prices from all systems could be viewed and set from one ugly UI.  And this allowed pricing analysts to sit together in a room in an office which made them more effective and economical while allowing the company to realize tax incentives from the state for creating jobs.

And each of us in our day do our best to create something worthwhile as we are swept along, tangentially aware of the rushing river all around.
