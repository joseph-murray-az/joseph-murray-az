title: The concept of zero
Tags: [origin, streamlining, innovation]

The concept of zero is said to come from India and, if true, means that for a time there was no concept of nothing in the west.  But like most of our "knowledge," since precise records are non-existent, no one really knows the truth, so we apply imagination.  It seems easy to imagine counting:  You have a number of objects on which you need to place a value.  But what if you have nothing?  What does that look like?  Is it a space, maybe a flat surface, on which you could place anything?  In this case, zero is a placeholder, dependent on everything, which represents the potential of anything.  What is the best anything?

When it comes to conceiving a product, we rarely start with zero.  We may be replacing something deprecated or adding to something in use.  In either case, we are building on work of the past.  Even in the rare 0:1 product, we rely on teardowns of existing products, thus our ideas are based on existing ideas.  In this respect, innovation is not the process of conjuring a non-existent into a blank space but transforming an existing idea or feature into a better version of itself.

In many cases, the reduction of an existing feature is the best innovation:  Less steps, less clicks, the streamlining of an existing process.  It is possible that the right choice may require no changes to an existing feature, it might be that the same feature can be presented in a different way--the steps towards an outcome might be rearranged, a document or video might be used to clarify the complex.  There is no essential change.

Good writing requires relentless editing, extraneous words are cut.  Relentless editing reduces output.  So too does relentless prioritization.  A good practice is to consider where you would draw the line if you were asked to cut your backlog in half:  What is needed, what can you do without?  The goal of the product manager is not to complete stories or increase output, it is to produce great products.  No product does everything well.  Great products do a few things really well and, if possible, the rest not at all.

In this sense, we learn to see through things, to understand the dependencies, to find the empty space where all things are possible.  And this is where we start our work.
