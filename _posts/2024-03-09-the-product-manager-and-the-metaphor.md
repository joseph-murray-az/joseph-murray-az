In 1897, Dr. Maria Montessori visited Romeâ€™s asylums for children with mental disorders.  It was there she observed that these children, sitting in their barren rooms, given nothing to keep them occupied, would invent games using crumbs of food leftover from mealtimes.

From these observations, she recognized that humans crave learning, and that learning is best done through interaction with concrete objects.  She started to develop her educational methods, which include the use of "manipulatives"  for play, discovery, and learning.

An example of a manipulative is the pink tower: a series of blocks ranging in size from one cubic centimeter to ten cubic centimeters.  Young children learn to stack these blocks from largest to smallest to create a stable structure.  

Older children, having developed size discrimination, pattern recognition, and spatial awareness are able to translate this collaborative play into an understanding of the abstract concepts commonly used in algebra, geometry, and science.

This method, based on how we learn, by using our encounters with real physical objects, through guidance and support, to develop the ability to move from the specific to the general, the concrete to the abstract, proved wildly effective.

During her lifetime, she continued to experiment with her methods, to observed students, to take notes, and to develop a method and a school that began to compete with the Roman system popularized by the Institutio Oratoria of Quintilian almost two millennia before her time.

This was her lifetime's work, her innovation, her disruption.

The way we work, the way we learn and understand, the innovations of now and then, the patterns and movements, movements and pause, the change that continually occurs becomes the constant.
