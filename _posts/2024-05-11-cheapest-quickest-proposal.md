Often product direction comes from those who pay the bills, or their representatives, and it seems difficult to change direction even when good money follows bad.  Yet, regardless of the source, poor product decisions reflect poorly on the product manager.  So what is the best approach when product direction runs contrary to strategy, empathy, and intuition?

To be honest, my inclination is to fault leadership.  This is common, in fact there is a name for this tendency:  The fundamental attribution error.  *I* think that bad decisions made *by others* are due to character rather than context--in context, there may be a good reason for a seemingly bad decision.  We do not always know why a decision is made, but there is a powerful way to manage unclear product direction before too much damage occurs and this is by choosing the cheapest possible solution.

The first step is to understand the ask.  It is easy to use a Word document or PowerPoint presentation to mock up a solution in order to visualize how the feature might appear when complete. Using these tools, demonstrate the proposal as you understand it, in person if possible, or share a recording if necessary.  You can use these tools to mimic the user experience, walking step by step through the proposed solution, and asking questions along the way.  This might need to be done iteratively; the media you use should allow quick adjustments to be made; the goal is to complete these steps as quickly and transparently as possible.  It may turn out that the request, once it is clarified, is aligned with product strategy after all.

Once a fair understanding of the request is attained, and the problem to solve is revealed, then put forward the cheapest possible solution.  Think of the case study of Zappos:  Before building out, a simple website and manual fulfillment were used to find out if there was demand for online shoes.  In this vein, find the quickest, cheapest way to make the feature available for user testing.  This too can be accomplished by the product manager using simple design tools or HTML.  Although good product managers are not cheap, a team of engineers is far more expensive, so the more the product manager can accomplish, the greater the savings.

Hypotheticals are difficult to understand, abstract ideas to communicate.  When the product manager is able to create something, even the wrong something, faults are exposed, and the tangled way is cleared.  In this way, the cheapest possible solution can lead to the most valuable product.
