Often product direction comes from those who pay the bills, or their representatives, and it seems difficult to change direction even when good money follows bad.  Yet, regardless of the source, bad product decisions reflect poorly on the product manager.  So what is the best approach when product direction runs contrary to strategy, empathy, and intuition?

To be honest, my inclination is to fault leadership.  This is common, in fact there is a name for this tendency:  The fundamental attribution error.  We think that bad decisions made by others are due to character rather than context while our own bad decisions are due to context rather than our character.  If I am able to move past my inclinations, and consider context, I may discover a good reason for a seemingly bad decision.  We do not always know why a decision is made, but there is a powerful way to manage bad product direction before too much damage occurs and this is by choosing the cheapest possible solution.

The first step is to understand the ask.  It is easy to use a Word document or PowerPoint presentation to mock up a solution, often the wrong one, in order to visualize how the feature might appear when complete.  You can use these tools to mimic the user experience, walking step by step through the proposed solution, and asking questions along the way.  It may be that the request is a good one poorly communicated.

Once a fair understanding of the request is attained, which should include the problem being solved, then focus on the cheapest solution.  Think of the case study of Zappos Shoes:  Before building out, a simple website and manual fulfillment were used to find out if there was demand for online shoes.  In this vein, find the quickest, cheapest way to provide the feature and test it out on users.  Again, this might not even be a working solution, it could be a simple HTML page or prototype that allows users to interact with the feature.

Although product managers are not cheap, this work can be done without the need to engage a team of engineers, which is a far more expensive approach.  The goal is to do these steps as quickly and transparently as possible.  Demonstrate the proposal, in person if possible, or recorded if necessary.

Conversations on abstract ideas are difficult, when nothing exists but what is imagined, faults in communication are exposed.  By creating something concrete, even making the wrong non-existent exist reduces the imagined choices.  And by doing this quickly and cheaply, the better approach can emerge.
