Why would a company choose to spend 5% or more of their annual budget on product management?  Some reasons are to improve strategic alignment, increase customer focus, improve resource allocation, become more responsive to the market, manage risks, and grow revenue.  All of these topics warrant explanation but, instead, I will distill them to _the efficient attainment of product-market fit:_  This is the exclusive domain, verily, the entirety of the value of the product manager.

**What does the efficient attainment of product market fit mean?**

Efficient means to achieve maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort; and product-market fit indicates the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand.  Put this together and you get the definition of the efficient attainment of product-market fit:  It is the process of achieving the alignment between a product and market needs in a manner that uses resources optimally and without waste.  

**What is strong market demand?**

Strong market demand indicates that a significant number of people recognize the value and necessity of a product, are willing to pay for it, and are likely to use it consistently.  Because payment may or may not be applicable, depending on your company or situation, I equate payment with usage.  In simple terms, this process looks like:

1. Identify a problem worth solving
2. Provide a feasible solution that gets used
3. Do this as efficiently as possible

**Identify a problem worth solving**

The world is full of problems or, depending on how you look at it, opportunities, but not all opportunities are worth pursuing.  Remember that the goal is to find a problem experienced by a significant number of people.  We often find ourselves working on problems experienced by a single loud or powerful user.  In some cases, this user may pay the bills, and thus may equate to a significant number of users, but generally this is not the goal.  

And how do you find these problems?  There are many sources, such as conversations, tickets, and observations, whichever means is the most efficient and effective should be used.  In the old days, we used to sit with users to watch them use the software, trying to be unobtrusive, trying not to give opinions or instructions, trying not to color the observations in any way.  A more efficient way to do this is to use a tool like HotJar to observe recordings of users.  To make this more efficient, you can filter recordings to narrow down the number, then randomly select a subset to watch, preferably less in number, more in focused observation.  (If you do not have an existing product to observe, for example when you feel you have identified a new problem space, you may want to explore a different technique, like the [product tear down](https://joseph-murray-az.github.io/2024/04/26/the-product-teardown.html)).

**Provide a feasible solution that gets used**

For the efficient product manager, once a problem worth solving has been identified, the next step is to provide a solution as cheaply as possible.  This requires a clear definition of the problem and the practice of ruthless prioritization to ensure that you solve the problem, only the problem, and nothing but the problem.  Despite our natural inclination to make our customer happy, the goal of the initial solution is to find out if the minimal delivery is enough.  You are likely to miss requirements, this is inevitable, and will happen no matter how much up-front time you spend, so best not to spend it.  Instead, put your first foot forward and learn from your mistakes, which is another form of ruthless prioritization, as you seek to learn what is essential to the solution.

During the creation of this solution, the appropriate measures should also be planned and, for the feasible solution that gets used the only measure of import is active usage.  Plan to measure active usage from the start since, as defined, strong market fit means that a significant number of people recognize the value and necessity of a product:  Active usage is the ballot box that tells you whether product-market fit has been found or not.

**Do this as efficiently as possible**

In all of the above, the maxim is to be efficientâ€”efficiency is the value provided by the product manager.  So why would a company choose to invest in a product manager?  A good product manager brings value to a product company through the efficient attainment of product-market fit.  And what is more important than this?
