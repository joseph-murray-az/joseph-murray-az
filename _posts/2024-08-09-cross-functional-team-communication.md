Many of the metaphors used for the creation of software products come from other disciplines, for example architecture from construction, production from manufacturing, not to mention scrum from rugby and sprints from, well, sprinting.  So it is natural that the practices that have been proven to yield positive results in these disciplines, especially in manufacturing, would be adapted to software development.  These practices have had varying outcomes.  

An early assumption was that, like manufacturing, repeatable processes used to develop software can be measured and improved, and there is some truth to this belief.  But unlike tin cans and airplane parts, where consistency is the hallmark of success, software products are more like works of art, where each product release can quite different from the last.  For this reason, the attempt to apply six sigma and total quality management (TQM) principles, staid techniques in modern manufacturing, have been largely unproductive when applied to software development.  

However, there is one aspect of all projects, no matter the variety, that is the same—communication—and it is a maxim that, no matter the endeavor, effective communication improves the odds of success.  It is with this in mind that I read the 1990 study titled “Patterns of Communication Among Marketing, Engineering and Manufacturing—A Comparison Between Two New Product Teams.”

This study compared two product teams tasked with designing a similar product (hinted at as automobile head and tail light systems).  The teams were similar in nature:  Both part of the same division, both reporting to the same division manager, both cross-functional teams made up of members of marketing, manufacturing, and engineering.  The difference between these teams is that one used the traditional phase-review process while the other used the new (at that time) Quality Function Deployment (QFD) process.  The difference in these processes was mainly in the patterns of communication.  As stated in the study:

>QFD changes communication patterns from “up-over-down” flows through management to more horizontal “across” routes where core team members communicate directly with one another.<sup>1</sup>

The findings of the study, which served as a practical illustration for the decades of previous studies cited in the paper, was that the team that used QFD had better cross-functional communication that resulted in a more successful project.  

For those currently working in a modern agile team, this may seem like an obvious epiphany.  But it was not so long ago that the waterfall approach, with all of its managed milestones and checkpoints, was standard practice.  In fact, despite the rollout of agile in many organizations, agile sprints remain contained in an overarching waterfall process.  And this may not be all bad: Some industries, especially those with onerous regulations, likely benefit from a structured approach with layers of oversight.  Nonetheless, there are drawbacks, the main one being that more time spent on administration is less time spent on building things.  This is true for engineers, this is true for product managers as well.

The product manager is often seen as the bridge between the product’s stakeholders and the team.  This is a reasonable expectation that is aligned with the skillset of most product managers.  In fact, those who excel in stakeholder communication are often recognized as the rising stars of product management.  But when the product manager becomes the stakeholder manager, or otherwise strays from team-time to administrative-time, as a member of the cross-functional team, it follows that the benefits of the cross-functional agile team are lost.  

It was pointed out in the study that, while cross-functional team communication increased, external communication decreased.  In this scenario, where teams traditionally communicated through their managers with suppliers and other external sources, it seems that this would have a detrimental effect.  But that was not the case, while the team using the phase-review approach did communicate well externally, the end result was less successful.  This indicates that the external communication was less productive than believed, perhaps consisting more of “check-ins” than purposeful conversations in quest of missing information.

Philosophers point how little we truly understand of ourselves and the world, that what we perceive is only appearance rather than the essence of things.  In corporate life, appearance is all that matters, and those most visible are often associated with the success that follows.  This fact can make the decision to engage with stakeholders, even at the expense of the product or the team, a smart career decision.  But when we cast aside appearance and take the time to review all actors, we may find that those that play supporting roles are actually the ones that bring the play to life.
