A generative AI powered tutor can provide students with personalized service, at any time of day or night, with no wait time.  But, in order for the chatbot to be successful, we need to ensure that the conversations help the student to learn the course materials.  This learning is quantitatively measured by test scores, which will take time and effort to collect.  In the meantime, to improve chatbot interactions, qualitative analysis can be used to determine if users are satisfied and their needs are fulfilled.  In addition, student interests may be discovered which can be used to enhance the conversations and improve engagement.  For this, we can use conversation analysis.

**Conversation Analysis**

Conversation analysis is usually applied to conversations between two or more humans, and includes the study of body language and other non-verbal cues.  For this, a model is used to illustrate the basic structures of a conversation, which includes the organization and rules for taking turns, for clarifying misunderstandings, and for moving the conversation towards action.  However, the analysis of a chatbot conversation is more limited, using only a transcript of the conversation between the chatbot and the user.  There are specialized types of conversation analysis, like discourse analysis or human-computer interaction, that might more aptly describe this study.  

Regardless, for this analysis, the chatbot transcript can be used to learn about student interests and potential performance, which is exceedingly difficult to do in person much less in an online school.  By learning the interests of the student, the chatbot can be programmed to present those interests to the students in order to motivate them to attain their goals. 

In order to conduct this research, the unit of analysis is determined by the research question.  Since we are studying the effectiveness of the chatbot, we can divide the transcript into episodes or turns that each contain a question and answer.  Then we can analyze each episode to determine the type of question posed along with the response.  Student questions and answers can indicate interests as well as effectiveness of chatbot responses.  In this context, chatbot questions and answers can be analyzed to determine trends and training.

**Goals and research questions**

The ultimate goal of education is to allow students to teach themselves.  In fact, in the words of Dr. Russel Ackoff:  "Although being taught is an obstruction to learning, teaching is a marvelous way to learn."<sup>1</sup>  If we get it right, the chatbot can facilitate the learning by allowing students to teach themselves.  In order to get it right, though, the chatbot has to prove value to the student.

A common experience, both for chatbots and human service, is for the user to quickly decide that the chatbot is not going to work.  In this case, our research question might be:  "What is it about the conversation that does not address the student's needs?"  In our early experience, we have noticed that generative AI responses are wordy, often producing explanations of the process to arrive at conclusions.  A first step is to direct the chatbot to get to the point--in other words, bypass wordy explanations. 

**Conclusion**

As with most areas in these later posts, there are many open questions that are yet to be answered.  As these areas are explored, I hope that our work is revealing and useful.  In the role of "reporter," I will return to this subject as progress is made.
