This is my penultimate post for 2024 and, as a review, the following is a retrospective on writing and practicing product management this year.

**What did I do well?**

Writing is difficult.  It is even more difficult when, along with family responsibilities, I am working full-time.  However, given that, I have succeeded in completing my 50th post, one each week since the start of the year, and I am proud of that accomplishment.

During this time, I have developed a deeper appreciation for those who write for a living, who face and meet regular deadlines, and who do it well.  This is an occupation that takes everything you have and more.

In addition, the reflection on what I am doing--while I am doing it--has caused me to spend more time and energy on problem definition and communication; on preparing for and presenting project progress; and on research and thought, which has resulted in some novel approaches to validation, analysis, and measures of success.

**What could I improve?**

In rereading my posts, I noticed extraneous material and awkward phrasing.  At the time, in the moment, what seems novel can later seem to be more of a distraction than an integral part of the work--and these moments can diminish the voice of authority and erode the foundation of the argument. The only cure may be less time writing, more time cutting and condensing what has been written.

Even so, I have learned to be less afraid of publishing the imperfect.  If there is one thing I have learned from product, you can't let the perfect get in the way of the good, especially when it comes to learning what works.

Of course, it is much easier to publish when you have no readers:  Turns out, while I am pretty good at the product, I am pretty bad at the marketing part of the product market fit.  And this is probably the best lesson to take into the next year.

**What is next?**

Although I have published this blog as if it were a finished work, this is only the raw material for something new.  There are many potential ways to combine this material--by category, by style, by topic--in order to create something better, more fluid, and more fun to read.

As preparation, my working theory is that great products are largely discovered by accident, and that regular product practice increases the likelihood of the occurrence of these accidents.  And this may be the starting point for what comes next.

I do love writing: Next year, I hope to learn to love editing as well; and to embrace, or at least tolerate, marketing.

**Epanadiplosis**

At the start of this blog, I used the metaphor of a river, which provides the banks that constrain the water and set the course toward an unknown destination ahead. From where I sit—or perhaps when—the water rushes ever faster as we ferry toward the mists of the upcoming new year.
