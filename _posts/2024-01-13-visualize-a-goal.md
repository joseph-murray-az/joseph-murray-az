title: Visualize a goal
---

Imagine an organization at its best, efficient and productive, innovative and fun, strategic and successful.  What would this require?

I think the best experience is when you find all individuals and teams working towards the same goal.

Early in my career, when I worked for Electronic Data Systems (EDS), I was tasked with babysitting the nightly processing of California Medicaid (aka Medi-Cal) claims.  To stay occupied, I was in the habit of appropriating my manager's office and reading selections from his shelf of books on management.

To this day, I have in my mind a description of the high motivation and focus of the teams at NASA during the Apollo moon launch mission described in one of these management books.  

In this book, one of the managers of the Apollo project had posted a large picture of the moon high up on the wall in the control room.  This picture served as a singular point of motivation and focus that aligned all employees towards the same goal.

Isn't this the aspiration of the product manager: to be able to produce and share a concrete image of success?
