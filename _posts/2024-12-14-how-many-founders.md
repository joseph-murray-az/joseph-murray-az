Management is the process by which businesses organize and direct workflows, operations, and employees to meet company goals.  The primary aim of management is to create an environment that enables employees to work efficiently and productively.  

In modern organizations, there are typically two types of managers:  Those who manage other managers and managers that manage teams.
 
Managers that manage teams can act as supervisors or individual contributors.  Supervisors tell people what to do and when to do it, expecting cooperation to complete tasks. When supervisors control employee promotions and pay, cooperation is likely.  
 
Conversely, managers who act as individual contributors often take a more collaborative approach. They communicate what needs to be accomplished but rely on team collaboration to determine how to achieve goals.

Such managers may also contribute their expertise directly to the work, providing them with a deeper understanding of the challenges and processes involved, but they rarely have control over employee incentives.

**Founder mode**

There is a movement away from traditional management as described above to what has been termed as "founder mode."<sup>1</sup>  In his article on this model, Paul Graham explains:

> In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their attempts to escape from it.

The article posits that founder mode is a better approach to running a company, an opinion presumably based on Paul Graham's experience working with startups.  (Not to mention, his business model). 

**Antiphony**

I see things differently.  As an individual contributor, and as a manager with a belief in the power of collaboration, I equate founder mode with micromanagement.  In a startup, especially at the beginning, founders are often required to do all things themselves.  But once the company is past the startup stage, continuing this approach disrupts the work of others and creates waste.

For example, as an engineering lead, I once worked for a manager who was in the habit of contributing to the project by writing code at night.  He had once been an engineer but, judging from the quality of his code, he was not a good one.  Or perhaps he was tired.  Whatever the case, before my team could start writing code at the start of the day, we had to remove the code that the manager added the previous night.  

I want to say that this is my only example, but it is not.  In fact, most of my career, I have worked with both founders and managers that were unable to let go of control, those who felt the need to micromanage the projects, even to the point of doing the work themselves.  And, for a variety of reasons, this typically did not go well.

**Epiphany**

The articles that I read on this subject, both pro and con, did give me a moment of clarity on my own view of the world.  I realized that I have often judged leaders of companies by their ability to manage.  But what I realized, especially for those who I felt were poor managers, is that they never claimed to be managers.  In fact, whether they consciously chose to or not, these folks were operating as founders.  And, as a result, I found myself and my teams being micromanaged.

Whether this mode worked out for the companies I worked for is beyond my scope.  But personally, I find it much less fun to be micromanaged than to manage and create a product in collaboration with a great team.
