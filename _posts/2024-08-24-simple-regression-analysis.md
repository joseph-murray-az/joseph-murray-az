At the outset, I must clarify that I am not a data analyst or statistician.  So, while I do have some schooling and experience, as in the kitchen and on the grill, not everything I concoct will come out as envisioned--some dishes will end up in the sink!  But, I will forge ahead inspired by the words of Chef Gusteau: "Anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great!"  

Returning to this new product, the goal is to provide insights for online school teachers that lead to effective actions.  But what exactly are **insights** and how do we determine which actions are **effective?**  This effort requires a recipe of science and speculation, with quantities unknown, and not without risk.  But we have the ingredients, our kitchen is equipped, our judges are present, and there is a line outside the door.  So let's get cooking.

As always, the first step is to quantify the problem we are trying to solve.  To do this, we ask:  *What would be the result of an effective action?*  In a school setting, success is typically measured by scores, so an improvement in scores would signal that an action was effective.  And why not aim for  perfect scores for all?  Because, besides being unrealistic, many students have ambitions outside of school.  Therefore, improvements in learning are better reflected on a relative scale.  Instead of striving for perfection, we reviewed the literature and, without overthinking it, set an immediate goal of a 10% increase in current scores for the students subject to these actions.

Now that we have established a goal, how do we achieve it?  Those who train for sports know that improvement comes from consistent effort. Elite athletes, however, focus on the aspects of their training that yield the greatest improvements with the least effort. Similarly, we need to identify the practices that lead to the greatest academic improvements. This is where science comes inâ€”specifically, the science of statistics.

Fortunately, due to an existing product, I have a set of metrics that can serve as a starting point for this exploration.  However, an insight is more than a metric, so there must be a hidden factor that can transform a metric into something meaningful.  This factor lies in the relationship between these metrics, known as dependent variables, and the measure we want to effect, the dependent variable.  To identify the variables with the strongest relationships, we use regression analysis, which is available in the Excel data analysis plug-in.  After a few iterations, the independent variable that stands out is course progress.

Admittedly, this might seem anticlimactic. Isn't it obvious that the students that make the most progress in class will have the highest scores?  This seems intuitive, but I am not so sure.  I can imagine scenarios where students rush through materials to make great progress at the expense of high scores.  But imagination and speculation must be tested against reality to produce evidence. Though this is a small step, it has yielded evidence that will guide our efforts in the coming week. So I will leave the matter here, and continue the story once the week ahead has been transformed into the week gone by.
