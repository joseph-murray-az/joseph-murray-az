What is a product manager?  Based on discussion boards, candidates I have encountered during interviews, and my own experience in multiple companies, I believe that the role of product manager can be broadly categorized into two types based on the balance between rigor and intuition required by the environment.  The environment is important:  Mature environments and brownfield investments generally require rigor when changes are made and new features introduced; startups and greenfield investments lean more heavily on intuition and experimentation to prove concepts.   

The term "product manager" is generally associated with the role that relies more heavily on intuition—often characterized by a "move fast and break things" mentality. However, the more rigorous role, sometimes disparagingly referred to as "project manager," while perhaps less glamorous, is equally important.  Both categories demand specific temperaments and skill sets suited to their respective approaches.

**Work that requires rigor**

When working in mature environments, with mature software, or in highly regulated industries, mistakes can be costly.  As a small example, as an engineer, I once worked on credit union bank statements.  As we approached the end of the last millennium and the maturity dates on certificates of deposit changed from 19-- to 20--, we produced statements granting millions of dollars in accrued interest to customers.  However, these statements were not sent out--this defect was caught by one of many defensive procedures that had been put in place over the previous decades.

At the same time, the company was marketing systems to new customers and, with increased development and usage of the internet, new features were still needed.  As a result, over time, the product role was eventually identified, although the description of this role had more in common with the project role that was being replaced.  It is, nonetheless, an important role which requires a specific skill set and temperament.  There are those who would say that this is not "product."  I would rather say that this is product—you are responsible for understanding the product, the business, and for constant and clear communication to all stakeholders—as is the case for all product managers.  But it is not to say that a product manager that is a good fit here would not be challenged when switching to a startup.  

**Work that requires intuition**

The transition from working as a product manager in a system of checks and balances--with clearly defined hierarchies, rules, and responsibilities--to the often improvised and sometimes lawless world of startups can be jarring.  In this type of environment, everything can seem like a gamble, features may be sold before they are created, experiments are often snuck in between deliveries, teams may be required to pivot mid-stride, the ground is always shifting, and this can be uncomfortable terrain for the risk averse. 

In this environment, while testing and data are still useful, even when available, due to the shortage of time, decisions often need to be made based on intuition rather than rigor.  Of course, the intuitive product manager can also be supported by the environment--the audience for products produced by startups tend to be more forgiving, applications are less likely to be mission critical, and users are often early adopters.  This type of audience is more tolerant of mistakes that can occur when software is released that is not complete and missing features and functions.

**Role and fit**

The work that we do is important, no matter the variety, and we all make a contribution according to our capacity.  Just as in all arts, there is structure and rules, challenges and obstacles, and an end product that can always be better.  But the skills and temperament that are needed can be quite different between environments.  I believe that, while taking into account our capacity to learn and grow, it is important to establish a clear understanding of the requirements for the specific role, based on the environment and investment type, in order to establish a good fit between the candidate and the role.
