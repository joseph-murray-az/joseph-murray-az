There are three ways to understand user behavior:  interviews, observations, and data analysis.  Each approach has the potential to provide valuable information that helps us to better understand our users.  Conversely, these methods might generate excessive data that obscures our insights and complicates our job.  The difference is in the aim:  The effort should be directed towards understanding what your users are trying to accomplish, what is stopping them, and what workarounds are used.  In other words, what jobs need to be done.<sup>1</sup>  When this happens, interviews, observations, and data analysis can be planned to produce the information needed for enlightened product management.

**What is the difference between data and information?**

Data is not information.  Data is the opinions expressed during interviews, actions taken during observations, and probabilities produced during data analysis.  Information is the accurate interpretation of this data.  This is an important distinction:  You rarely, if ever, get information from data without effort: Whether you do it yourself, or you are able to rely on experts, the work of product management is to extract from this data the information needed to make informed product decisions.  

Informed product decisions are not always certain.  You may have compiled enough information to decide to run an experiment, to test a theory, or validate an epiphany.  (Even epiphanies arrive while, consciously or unconsciously, contemplating information).  The effort taken to understand the data, and to derive information from it, makes the difference between intentional product development and the aimless production of new features.

**Too much data**

While having more data is often seen as a good thing, when you are looking for information it is easy to get lost in the data you collect.  For example, conversations with users can meander and you may learn all kinds of things, from professional grievances to personal problems, without ever getting to the area of focus.  It takes a special skillset, and proper preparation, to conduct fruitful surveys and interviews with users.  So consider yourself lucky if you have access to a professional user researcher, and make use of her skills!  

Otherwise, if you have to do it yourself, make sure to carefully plan your conversations, and be careful to avoid your own biases for solutions.  The same goes for observations, whether in person or using a tool to view recorded interactions.  While observing users unfiltered actions can lead to accidental discoveries, you can save a lot of time by filtering recordings and selecting only those directly related to the area under study.

The same applies when it comes to sifting through collections of data.  In this case, a good grasp of statistical analysis is paramount.  Statistical analysis is also a special skill which combines knowledge of techniques with interpretation of resultsâ€”and knowing when to stop short of conclusions based on probabilities.  If an expert is not available, it is not impossible to do the task yourself using a good book, a chat model, and with some time spent methodically walking through the steps from description to analysis.

**Too little data**

It is rare to work in a software organization that does not have too much data, but not uncommon for the data you need to be missing or unaccessible.  Perhaps surprising, product managers are not always able to access to their users, either due to regulations, protections, or location: Privacy laws can come into play, managers may need to protect their people from interruptions, and users may be distant or indistinguishable.  As with everything, we have to use what is available.  Sometimes you have to be resourceful, a screenshot or image loaded into an AI chat session can sometimes yield surprising results.

**What are the jobs to be done?**

But even when access to users and data is available, it is pointless without a goal, which is to learn three things:

- What are the jobs to be done?
- What is getting in the way?
- What workarounds are being used? 

We need to understand what our users are trying to get done so that we can find a way to do this better.  

Learning what the jobs to be done of your customers is difficult, so much of what we do is what needs to be done, rather than what can be done, and we can feel guilty of doing the latter at the expense of the former.  There may also be things that should be done, tasks and activities that we avoid because they are unpleasant, difficult, or undefined.  This nuanced experience sometimes makes it difficult to clearly state what we do.  And of course, as the Bobs in Office Space, illustrate when they ask the question:  what would you say it is that you do?  It is not an easy question to answer.  But for us, these situations can be seen as opportunities as well, a chance to create software that users hire to do the things they do not want to do, and thus allow them to do the other things that make their jobs enjoyable.

**Getting to information**

On occasion, we connect the right solution to the right problem at the right time for the right audience.  To get there, we need to use all available tools and techniques, not indiscriminately, but with intention and purpose, focused on the helping users to get something done, something of value, so that our users not only hire our software to help them get their jobs done, but retain us as well.
