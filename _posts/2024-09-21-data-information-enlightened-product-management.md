There are three ways to understand user behavior:  interviews, observations, and data analysis.  While each approach has the potential to provide valuable information that can help us to better understand our users, these methods can also generate excessive data that serves only to obscure our insights and complicate our job.  The difference is in the aim:  The effort should be directed towards understanding what your users are trying to accomplish, what is stopping them, and what workarounds are used.  In other words, what jobs need to be done.<sup>1</sup>  When this happens, interviews, observations, and data analysis can be planned to produce the information needed for enlightened product management.

**What is the difference between data and information?**

Data is not information.  Data is the opinions expressed during interviews, actions taken during observations, and probabilities produced during data analysis.  Information is the accurate interpretation of this data.  This is an important distinction:  You rarely, if ever, get information from data without effort.  Whether you do it yourself, or you are able to rely on experts, the work of product management is to extract from this data the information needed to make informed product decisions.  

Informed product decisions are not always certain.  You may have compiled enough information to decide to run an experiment, to test a theory, or validate an epiphany.  (Even epiphanies arrive while, consciously or unconsciously, contemplating information).  The effort taken to understand the data, and to derive information from it, makes the difference between intentional product development and the aimless production of new features.

**Too much data**

While having more data is often seen as a good thing, when you are looking for information it is easy to get lost in the data you collect.  For example, conversations with users can meander and you may learn all kinds of things, from professional grievances to personal problems, without ever getting to the area of focus.  It takes a special skillset, and proper preparation, to conduct fruitful surveys and interviews with users.  So consider yourself lucky if you have access to a professional user researcher, and make use of her skills!  

Otherwise, if you have to do it yourself, make sure to carefully plan your conversations, and be careful to avoid your own bias for solutions.  The same goes for observations, whether in person or using a tool to view recorded interactions.  Although the observation of users' unfiltered actions can lead to accidental discoveries, you can save a lot of time by filtering recordings and selecting only those directly related to the area under study.

The same need for a plan applies when it comes to sifting through collections of data.  In this case, a good grasp of statistical analysis is paramount.  Statistical analysis is also a special skill which combines the knowledge of techniques with the interpretation of resultsâ€”and knowing when to stop short of conclusions based on probabilities.  If an expert is not available, it is possible (though time consuming) to do the task yourself using a good book, a chat model, and an Excel spreadsheet or Jupyter notebook.  (I can recommend Advancing into Analytics: From Excel to Python and R by George Mount).<sup>2</sup>  In any case, whether you do it yourself or leverage the expertise of others, this activity also starts with a plan.

**Too little data**

It is rare to work in a software organization that has too little data, but not uncommon for the data you need to be missing or unaccessible.  Also, and perhaps surprising, product managers are not always able to access  their users, either due to regulations, protections, or location--privacy laws can come into play, managers may need to protect their people from interruptions, and users may be distant or indistinguishable.  As with everything, we have to use what is available and be resourceful, for example a screenshot loaded into an AI chat session can sometimes yield surprising results.

**What are the jobs to be done?**

Even when access to users and data is available, it is pointless without a goal.  Because we need to understand what our users are trying to get done, we ask the following three questions:

- What are the jobs to be done?
- What is getting in the way?
- What workarounds are being used? 

By understanding what our users are trying to accomplish, and what is preventing them from doing so, we can reveal opportunities to create software that users "hire" to make these jobs more enjoyable and satisfying.

**Getting to information**

On occasion, we connect the right solution to the right problem at the right time for the right audience.  To get there, we need to use all available tools and techniques, not indiscriminately, but with intention and purpose, focused on the helping our users to get something done.  And that is a worthwhile endeavor.
