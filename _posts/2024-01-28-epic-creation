In my current practice, we define an epic to contain these four parts:  What?  Why?  What does success look like?  Measures.

These four parts of the epic are not long, each consists of perhaps two to three bullet points, and they often summarize a product brief or an actionable part of a product initiative. 

What, why, and success statements are used to define the problem and the value that can be realized by solving that problem.  For example, a process might be expensive and, by redefining the process, the expense can be reduced or eliminated.

The most important and difficult part of creating the epic I have found is the creation of the measures.  Even a simple measure like reducing expenses can be difficult to quantify if you do not know the cost--we do not always know the costs of a company's employees, infrastructure, or overhead--sometimes you have to find measures that approximate the goal.  For example, the number of steps in a procedure can be substituted for cost savings of employee time.

By answering the three questions and providing meaningful (i.e. quantifiable) measures, we avoid working on a solution, leaving this to the team, and instead focus on the desired results.

It seems like common knowledge that the problem needs to be clearly defined before it can be solved.  In practice, it is not uncommon for teams to work on solutions without knowing the problem to solve. 

By thinking through the three questions, and especially by defining measures that prove success, I find I am better able to create a well written epic.
