As in life, product managers experience change and face challenges, especially those of us who work in technology.  I am thinking about this lately because I am starting a new product:  A product for which I am struggling to identify existing patterns and practices.  It is true that every product and feature is unique; thus the effort to create something new always includes some unique challenges.  But, perhaps once or twice in your career, due to a burgeoning new technology, the challenge is amplified. At this time, the challenge is due to the advent of generative AI.
 
Generative AI consists of advanced models capable of not just understanding and processing language, but generating entirely new content based on the input received.  For this, transformative generators take raw data, user queries, and contextual information to produce insights, recommendations, and creative outputs that were previously unimaginable. They are not merely tools for automation, but engines of innovation that can drive the creation of new products, services, and even industries.  As an example, [and due to my lack of mastery of the subject], this paragraph was [mostly] generated.

So what are the challenges posed by generative AI?  To be honest, I do not know.  From my current perspective, at the start of the project, when no product exists, my main question is where do I start?  I know that I have a problem to solve; access to data, foundation models, and engineers; an endless horizon of available books and training materials of varying qualities; and a shortage of time.  From experience, I know I can rat-hole on analysis, going ever deeper in search of an insight and, at the end of the day, becoming no wiser.  I also know that others have done this before, some have even made it seem easy.  I anticipate changes in myself.

In the beginning of a new product, the end-state is outside of our perception; we are only able to imagine what it might look like from a small set of known possibilities; we do not see, we do not know.  There is an ocean of opportunities:  There is failure, and success, and endless variations of both.  And there are lessons along the way.  It may be that the starting point is at the end.  And for that reason, this thought is to be continued.
