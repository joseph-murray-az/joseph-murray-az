In high school chemistry, I learned of the second law of thermodynamics which states that all systems move from higher energy to higher entropy.  We see this in play all around us in the physical world:  Things fall apart.  A cup falls from the table and shatters on the floor.  If time were reversed, the shards would rise from the floor to reform the cup.  But this is not what happens.  In this world, time moves in one direction:  The cup is made as energy is released, the cup is broken as entropy takes over.  This also known as the arrow of time.  

The arrow of time is the reason for the product manager to exist.  In our world, there is a product lifecycle from idea and implementation through maturation and product decline.  This reflects the rise and fall of energy, the fall and rise of entropy.  The constant throughout these cycles is the effort required to achieve higher organization in the face of rising entropy.  This leads to some important practices.

First, start simple.  We know that our successful products will increase in complexity over time.  More users means more features, more features means more engineers, and both lead to higher complexity.  So why overthink at the origin?  Be ruthless in prioritizing, combine, condense, reduce.  Aim for the most simple solution that will adequately satisfy the need, then find out from real users what is actually used, and toss the rest.  

Second, eschew documentation.  We know that what we organize today will become unorganized as we proceed.  The one pagers you write today will become the encyclopedias of tomorrow, and even the second hand bookstore will refuse to take them off your hands.  The best plans are like sand paintings, seen as a medium for expressing a thought, swept away or reused once the purpose is served.  For products, aim for no documentation by creating a product so simple to use that no documentation is needed. 

Third, let go.  Nothing is permanent.  The products you create, if you are lucky, will be used; if you are intentional, will solve a problem.  But eventually, products become obsolete.  This is an opportunity to practice detachment.  The feeling of flow sometimes attained while creating something, the synergy experienced when a team is all in, the sense of ease when all are focused and moving in the same direction, this is the aim and this too will pass.  Proper preparation can lead to these moments, enjoy them when the arise, then move on.  

The arrow of time is one of the unsolved questions of general physics.  While the flow of time is universal and absolute, it has not been reconciled with the four dimensional spacetime theory of general relativity.  This means that what we experience does not match what we have deduced, what we have imagined.  The arrow of time points to the decrease of free energy and the increase of entropy, yet entropy may be one of the few processes that is not time-reversible.  If you are a doer, a maker, a problem solver, this can be a source of inspiration and an opportunity to uncover hope.
