title: The hack-a-thon
---

Why would a product manager participate in a hack-a-thon?  This is coding for coders, a chance for engineers to build something they wanted to build while building what others want them to build.  

For a product manager, following the strategy, ruthlessly prioritizing stories, laser focused on minimizing and delivering, the same opportunities are available to further explore a potential missed opportunity, tangential topic, or personal project.  

The hack-a-thon provides an opportunity to create and share a vision and persuade others to join in:  You can truly be the CEO of your product.

Along with the opportunity, there is the risk of failure, and a hack-a-thon can provide a low cost way to quickly fail and learn.

Teams are able to create products without product managers although someone usually has to play the role, which is part of the fun of a hack-a-thon, product managers can work on engineering tasks, engineers can become product managers.  The product manager role in a hack-a-thon is the same as in the workplace, it is to find the product market fit, otherwise the hack-a-thon is a coding exercise.

I have taken the role of product manager in several hack-a-thon projects, all but one eventually found their way to the roadmap.  The one outlier is an AI tool called My Data Analyst, an experiment in leveraging the OpenAI feature Advanced Data Analytics.  The goal was to provide the product manager with their own data analyst.  In the microcosm of this hack-a-thon, the resulting product failed to fit the market.

A fun project, yes, that included pizza, rotating cat pictures and cat facts, and several entertaining innovations.  But was also a low-cost experiment and opportunity to learn.  And, with the boundless optimism of a product manager, I say there may be a market yet.
