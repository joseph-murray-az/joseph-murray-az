title: The problem of ageism

There is a problem that is particularly acute in the technology industry:  Ageism.  I recognized it when I was a young software engineer, I have been experiencing it since my last layoff.  This is empirical, but there is more.  Forums, articles, studies, and legislation all support ageism as a problem.  

What is ageism?  According to the World Health Organization:  "Ageism refers to the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or oneself based on age."  In theory, this could apply to any age, a person could be perceived as too old, or too young, for a situation or responsibility.  But taken in the context of older workers in the workplace, ageism is unjust.  So what do we do about it?

We discuss it.  And there is a pattern to the discussion:  Technology forums take two sides, it is a problem that is blocking me; it is a problem but, due to my diligence, it is not blocking me.  I have experienced both sides of this argument, feeling at times immune and, more often of late, vulnerable. 

Articles written on the subject discuss the problem, and usually follow with advice:  A common formula is to propose being open, willing to learn, and maintaining an optimistic attitude.  Personally, I find none of this beneficial, especially when the advice is followed by a pitch for consulting or other services.

But from even a cursory review, the general agreement is that there is a problem.  And, although there are different opinions on what can be done, they fall into the following buckets:  Legislation, education, and bootstrap.

In the U.S., there has been legislation:  More than a half-decade ago, congress passed The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.  Yet, in June of 2018, the acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission included in her report on the 50th anniversary of the act that, according to expert witnesses, "age discrimination remains a significant and costly problem for workers, their families, and our economy."  Thus it seems, while legislation can and does help, it is not a cure.   

Education is another approach.  There is some truth to discrimination, in the sense of recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another, otherwise half the world's population would not be "â€¦ageist against older people."  But discrimination can work two ways:  It can diminish or it can amplify.  We diminish by discounting the relevance of experience; we amplify by putting too much stock in advice based on age.  But the middle way is to remove the potential for discrimination through blindness:  Judge the candidate based on a phone call or written work, which can highlight the ability to organize and communicate ideas, while removing visual cues that might unjustly bias decisions.

As for the last, we expect those who struggle to bootstrap themselves: This advice seems to flow when we feel we have bootstrapped ourselves, when we believe in self-determination, when we believe that our destiny comes from our own power.  We should all be entitled to these beliefs.  But, if I am honest, I realize this is easy advice when I am blessed with success, less so when I am suffering setbacks.  Tied to fortune, these words are capricious and often out of touch.

There are few that will dispute that a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints make a better team, although there are perhaps fewer that would put that into practice.  But that does not make it less true.  When older and younger people work together, especially when solving problems and creating products, the synergy created results in a more thorough understanding of the problem, a higher level of empathy for users, and a greater perception of the world in which our products will live and die.  The results will be twofold:  Better, more complete, products will be produced;  And teams like this, composed of a variety of people of all backgrounds and ages, will solve the problem of ageism, by definition.

And regardless, what matters more than results?
