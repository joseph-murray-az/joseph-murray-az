title: The problem of ageism

There is a problem that is particularly acute in the technology industry:  Ageism (1).  I recognized it when I was a young software engineer, I have been experiencing it since my last layoff.  This is empirical, but there is more.  Forums, articles, and studies all indicate that ageism is a problem. 

What is ageism?  According to the World Health Organization:  

>Ageism refers to the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or oneself based on age (2).

In theory, this could apply to any age, a person could be perceived as too old, or too young, for a situation or responsibility.  But taken in the context of older workers in the workplace, ageism is unjust.  So what do we do about it?

We discuss it.  And there is a pattern to the discussion:  Technology forums take two sides; it is a problem that is blocking me; it is a problem but, due to my diligence, it is not blocking me.  I have experienced both sides of this argument, feeling at times immune and, more often of late, vulnerable.  Articles written on the subject discuss the problem, and usually follow with advice:  A common formula is to propose being open, willing to learn, and maintaining an optimistic attitude.  I do not find this particularly beneficial either, especially when the advice is followed by a pitch for consulting or other services.  But what I do find beneficial is that there is a general agreement that ageism is a problem.  And, there are opinions on what can be done, which fall into the following buckets:  Legislation, education, and self-power, otherwise known as the bootstrap approach.

In the U.S., there has been legislation:  More than a half-decade ago, congress passed The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (3).  Yet, in June of 2018, the acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission included in her report on the 50th anniversary of the act that, according to expert witnesses, "age discrimination remains a significant and costly problem for workers, their families, and our economy" (4).  Thus it seems, while legislation does exist, and possibly helps, it is not a cure.

Education is another approach and it can help to investigate the root cause of the problem.  This starts by recognizing that, in the sense of discrimination defined as "recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another" (5), that there is some inherent trait in all of us at play, otherwise half the world's population would not be "â€¦ageist against older people" (2).  Following discrimination, prejudice can work two in ways:  It can diminish or it can amplify.  We diminish by discounting the relevance of experience; we amplify by putting too much stock in stereotypical assumptions and biases.  To find the middle way, we can remove the potential for prejudice through blindness:  For example, try judging the candidate based on a phone call or written work, which can highlight the ability to organize and communicate ideas, while removing visual cues that might unjustly bias decisions.

As for the last approach, we expect those who struggle to bootstrap themselves: This advice seems to flow when we feel we have bootstrapped ourselves, when we believe in self-determination, when we believe that our destiny comes from our own power.  We should all be entitled to these beliefs.  But this advice seems to flow when we are blessed with success; yet seems restricted when we suffer setbacks; tied to fortune, these words are capricious and often out of touch.

There are few that will dispute that a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints make a better team, perhaps fewer that would purposely put that into practice.  But that does not make it less true.  When older and younger people work together, especially when solving problems and creating products, the synergy created results in a more thorough understanding of the problem, a higher level of empathy for users, and a greater perception of the world in which our products will live and die.  The results are twofold:  Better, more complete, products are produced; teams like this, composed of a variety of people of all backgrounds and ages, working together, by definition, are the solution to the problem of ageism.   

And, regardless of all else, what matters more than results?
