Systems thinking explains that new features affect the system as a whole.  Why do we care?  Isn’t this the domain of systems engineers?  If you view your role as product manager solely as responsible for the creation of new features, and this is the extent of your checklist, then there may be little reason to care.  However, if you consider yourself part of a whole, a member of an ecosystem, and your job as improving the system and, by extension, the organization, then you should care.  Nothing we do stands in isolation: This is the theory of dependent origination and the foundation of systems thinking. This concept has profound implications.
 
**What is an ecosystem?**
 
An ecosystem is a metaphor taken from biology and applied to ecology to describe the community of interacting organisms and their physical environment.  In general use, it refers to a complex network of interconnected systems, which can describe a company and its market.  For a product manager working in technology, a practical approach might be to consider the ecosystem as the system itself, the teams that support it, and its users. Given this focus, systems thinking implies that every change made to the system should consider the aggregate—the system as a whole—rather than just a particular part.
 
**Implications for the product manager**
 
Software systems are generally tools that help users in a business or organization to get jobs done.  The product manager has long been pictured as sitting at the confluence of the system's technology (engineering teams) and the business practices (system users). When planning features, a systems thinking approach means considering not just how the system as a whole enables the business, but also how the parts of the system work together to perform this function.  

For example, in a supply chain scenario, this means considering how changes in inventory determination might affect point-of-sale transactions, sales orders, and other sales and fulfillment functions. Furthermore, when considering the application of generative transformer technology to provide predictive capabilities to this same inventory determination scenario, you need to understand the costs and benefits of the technology, along with the domain and use cases, in the context of the business and jobs to be done. You must also consider what this change might mean to the system as a whole.

**Implications for the company**
 
Current corporate culture often undervalues retention, which is crucial for an effective approach to systems thinking. Consider this: Using a conservative estimate of 10 lines of code per day with 200 working days per year, a team of ten would produce around 20,000 lines of code annually. Add to this all other teams, multiple years of work, integrations with other systems, operating systems, infrastructure, and platforms, along with industry knowledge and relationships, and you quickly approach a hellalot to learn.  

Given this complexity, it's not surprising that it may take years or even decades to compile a working knowledge of many systems. Moreover, it often takes a certain chemistry among these experienced individuals to create great teams capable of high-level thinking. However, because this value is not reflected in accounting practices, stock market valuations, or current interest rates, the importance of retention is often overlooked. Instead, it's interpreted as a variable cost that can be reduced during turbulent times. Systems thinking requires a long-term career path in a culture of short-term focus.
 
**Summary**
 
When we understand a system less as a sum of its parts and more as the synergy of the whole, our decisions, feature priorities, and technology selections may differ significantly. In this case, the effect on the system as a whole may be less than expected when considering only the individual parts. Regardless of how isolated we may feel, we are a dependent part of the whole.
