title: What is this blog about?
---

This blog is about product management.  Or perhaps random thoughts about product management from a practicing product manager.  I am starting with a loose plan and a goal to maintain a consistent flow of posts throughout the year.  Let's see where this goes. 

As a general statement, I have found that managing software products is an inherently fluid and ever-evolving endeavor. Despite the illusion of a well-defined path, the reality is that even the most meticulously laid plans can take unexpected turns and digressions.

So I supposed experience provides an excuse for what may prove to be a meandering river made up of streams and eddies, rapids and stagnant pools, ever flowing towards the sea.
