Sometimes the product manager lives in the past and imagines the future, for example, when in charge of a legacy product.  The term I have heard for this situation is the "classic nightmare."  I disagree.

Legacy products are often the ones that pay the bills, have solved real world problems, have accumulated users, and may have traversed the product lifecycle from innovation to adoption to maturation even to decline.  (You may be asked to "sunset" your product).  And yet there are lessons in all situations.

The code of a legacy product is like a rock formation to an archeologist:  It can reveal the past--bright ideas, arguments, political and economic shifts, technological evolutions.  

For example, I remember seeing an argument between two long departed engineers that was displayed in conflicting code and comments.  I have also seen congressional bills reflected in notes and updates to government software.

This may seem trivial but the first reflects a lack of alignment to product vision and corporate strategy, the second the ability to pivot to adapt to changes.  A good product manager is responsible for both.

There are challenges of managing a mature product that do not exist for new innovations:  There can be a large user base that will harshly judge even incremental changes, there may be a lack of budget, reluctance to invest, dearth of oversight, apathy, ennuiâ€¦and freedom.

A product manager that is not in the spotlight is free to make decisions, set goals, motivate teams, measure results, and is given an opportunity to learn from the users of the product.  This can be the best role to realize personal and professional growth.

And when the day comes that the product manager with legacy experience is thrust into the glaring light of a new innovation or 0:1 product, it can feel like reaching the pavement after running in sand.  With lessons from the past, experience in making the most of the least, a deeper understanding of users, and knowing what it takes to motivate a team, it can feel like there is no end to what can be accomplished.

The past and the future, neither exist, and who can capture the moment?
