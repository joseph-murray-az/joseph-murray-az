Reading an article on deadlines, I was struck by the following sentence:  Constraints foster creativity and resourcefulness.<sup>1</sup>  This seems to be a true statement, history is full of illustrations, but it makes me curious:  What are constraints and how do they inspired us to grow?

**Definitions**

When looking to define a constraint, I came across the following synonyms:
  
- Restrictions: generally external limits imposed by outside factors, such as laws, rules, or physical limitations
- Inhibitions: internal barriers that come from within a person, often based on fears, doubts, or psychological factors
 
In other words, a constraint can be extrinsic, like a company running out of money, or intrinsic, like the fear of speaking out in a toxic culture.  In exploring reactions to constraints, I also found two characteristics that are impacted by external and internal forces:

- Motivation: often influenced by external factors such as rewards, recognition, deadlines, and external encouragement
- Drive: an internal characteristic that propels a person to pursue goals and persist in the face of challenges

If a product manager is motivated by money, and a company runs out of money, this would be a restriction that impacts motivation, in this case probably in a negative sense.  But for a product manager (or more likely a founder), the same scenario might create the drive to overcome the restriction with creative solutions for funding.  

Likewise, if a product manager feels inhibited, for example by fear, he or she may judge that there is a reward for speaking out in certain cases and use this motivation to overcome this inhibition.  But a product manager driven by a sense of righteousness, may speak out in favor of a change or, possibly, choose to make that change themselves.

These definitions and scenarios, while perhaps illuminating, do not really illustrate how constraints foster creativity and resourcefulness. A better explanation can be found by exploring cognitive load and decision fatigue.

**Constraints reduce options**

Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort and working memory required to process and understand information or complete a task.  Cognitive load theory (CLT) suggests that we have a limited capacity for processing information and overload can lead to decision fatigue, which hinders our ability to get things done. 

While this may be a theory, there are practical applications that demonstrate this effect.  For example, retailers have learned that, when customers are presented with a long list of product options, they are less likely to make a purchase.  So instead of providing an infinite variety of product features, retailers may bundle features into sets that are presented under the labels of good, better, best.  Among other benefits, such as segmentation and differentiation, this presentation eases decision making.  

Similarly, constraints are used to ease decision making in product management as well.

**The triple constraint**

For years project managers have used the project triangle, or triple constraint, to explain the effect of changes on outcomes.  The idea is that all projects are subject to three constraints--time, money, and scope--and a change in any one will impact the others.  For example, a reduction in funding will mean an increase in time or a reduction in scope.

Product management recognizes the triple constraint through the definition of the minimum viable product (MVP).  This can be represented by the same triangle but, rather than focusing on the impact of each side of a large triangle, the idea of the MVP is to make the triangle itself smaller by intentionally reducing scope to enable the delivery of an inexpensive product in a short amount of time.  If this MVP is successful, then additional funding may be justified; otherwise, the product may be abandoned in favor of more profitable efforts.

**Physical and psychological constraints**

While constraints can be used to create products more efficiently, facing constraints can cause profound effects as well.   I have been watching a documentary called "Limitless" in which the actor Chris Hemsworth, with help from experts and scientists, takes on challenges that require him to combat the fear, physical, and mental exhaustion brought on by exposure to extreme conditions, for example, freezing water and perilous heights.  In each episode, the actor reaches his physical and psychological limits, beyond which he suddenly discovers the ability to relax, regain focus, and perform.  

Although in less amplified circumstances, when we are working on a product and are faced with unexpected constraints, especially those that appear exceedingly difficult to overcome, we often find a different perspective brought about by what is known as divergent thinking.  Divergent thinking can be described by: 

1. fluency – the ability to develop large numbers of ideas
2. flexibility – the ability to produce ideas in numerous categories
3. originality - the ability to produce unusual or unique ideas, and
4. elaboration – the ability to adapt abstract ideas into realistic solutions

These types of creative thinking helps us to produce ideas and alternatives that that can be used to overcome constraints.

**Constraints and growth**

From experience and observation, I believe there is something beyond our physical and mental consciousness that provides support, amplifies our abilities, and which allows us to overcome restrictions and inhibitions.  Constraints, restrictions, and inhibitions are inevitable, yet paradoxically provide opportunities to learn and grow.  It is our own physical and psychological makeup that allows this growth, which lies dormant in the face of freedom, and comes alive only when faced with constraints.
