title: Measuring engagement
---

In my current field, education technology, the ultimate goal is to positively impact student outcomes.  In other words, to increase student graduation rates, reduce dropouts, improve attendance, elevate grades and scores.  

As a goal, positively impacting student outcomes is broad and general, qualitative, and outside of the control of the product manager:  How could a product manager possibly control for the myriad of external factors that interfere with a student's performance?

Rather than  focusing on what can impact student outcomes, what if we turn the problem around and focus on the product itself?  It is a given that software that is not used will have no impact, so we can start by measuring software use or engagement.

One of the widely used measures of engagement is the "stickiness" measure or daily over monthly active usage.  This measure works reasonable well although there are some caveats.  For one, high daily usage can be derived from a small but dedicated user base, which is fine unless you aim to expand your audience.

In addition, these measures fluctuate, and are better compared to a finger in the wind than an anemometer:  In other words, they are best used to determine general direction rather than as a specific measure of engagement.

For these reasons, I prefer to collect the number of new and active users over time.  By capturing these counts daily, which can be done using Google Analytics or other similar tools, not only can the ratios be determined, but trends and volume of active usage over time can be seen as well.

As an example, for measures of a product used by parents and students in an online school, I found that the daily over monthly active usage dropped off each weekend.  In addition, I noticed that usage gradually drops off as the semester progresses, and falls off a cliff during breaks and holidays.

These are logical and expected findings, which perhaps could have been assumed without bothering to collect the data and visualize the result.  But by capturing this data each day over a period of time, a baseline for comparing engagement and trends evolves which can be used to more clearly see the impact of future product decisions.

The setup can be difficult but as the saying goes:  When the art of counting and measuring and weighing is removed, what remains is insignificant by comparison.
