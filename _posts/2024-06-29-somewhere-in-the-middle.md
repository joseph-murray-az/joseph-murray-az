I am in the middle of this exercise.

"In the middle" is an idiom that signifies something unpleasant, as in, "I am caught in the middle"; or, less unpleasantly, as in, "I am in the middle of something." In the current context, being the last day of June 2024, it is the middle of the current year, just past the summer solstice, which apparently happened on June 20th, and just before the second half of the year, which starts in July. It is also, in my mind, the middle of this blog. My commitment when I started was one year of blogging and, for this, I am halfway through.

In the mornings when I swim, especially when attempting a new distance, I keep track of laps by segments: one quarter done, one-third of the way, halfway there, etc. For a 1500, halfway means the turn at the wall at 750, perhaps somewhere around 15 minutes (give or take, probably more give). Before I know it, especially if I drift and perhaps lose count, I am done. But not really. A common joke when leaving the pool: You are never done; you are just taking a break.

My idea of flow is the ability to engage in a difficult--or not so difficult--activity without the mental constructs of start or finish, just doing and not doing according to instinct and feel. Being all the time busy and moving, I read and write when the house quiets down, while waiting, while otherwise unoccupied. I fit activities in as I can, which is its own flow, although sometimes, looking up, I notice I am late. It can be an occupation, a digression, a tangent, a day in life.

There are other times when all I can imagine is the end. At the start of this week, I joined a group for an ocean swim around the pier at Oceanside. Perhaps from the coldness of the ocean, the tightness of the wetsuit, the difficulty of the swim, or the strength of the tide, I struggled to catch my breath and considered turning back. On the other side of the pier, I finally relaxed and, realizing my rhythm, pointed down the shoreline and began to enjoy the swim, glad that I had not turned back.

Although never done, this feels significant. I have been able to maintain a thread on the subject of product management for half a year. Without ideas, even appearances, only a guess at where I might be heading, I see a lane from one side to the other, and I am mid-stroke with my head raised, aiming towards the other shore.

And I am somewhere in the middle.
