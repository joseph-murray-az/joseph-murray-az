In Atul Gawande's 2013 New Yorker article "Slow Ideas," the surgeon and founder of Ariadne Labs discusses the differing adoption rates of two significant surgical innovations: anesthesia and sterilization.<sup>1</sup> While anesthesia was rapidly embraced by surgeons for its immediate benefit of pain relief—allowing operations without the need to restrain conscious patients—sterilization did not see the same quick acceptance. Despite its crucial role in reducing postoperative infections and deaths, sterilization lacked immediate visible results and clashed with the then-prevailing belief that a bloodied surgeon was a sign of a successful practice. This disparity in adoption rates offers valuable insights into how the perceived immediacy of benefits and alignment with existing beliefs can influence the acceptance of new ideas, providing relevant parallels to the adoption of software products in the tech industry.

**Perceived Immediacy of Benefits**

Consider Slack, a product that appears "viral" but whose ease of use was years in the making. Originating from a failed gaming company, Tiny Speck, Slack (initially called Linefeed) was developed to facilitate communication among developers working on the game Glitch.<sup>2</sup> After the failure of Glitch and the resulting pivot to Slack, it took several years and multiple funding rounds before rapid growth was realized. While Slack's adoption seemed sudden, it was built on the extensive development and the fun, game-like elements from Glitch that made it addictive. A significant challenge for Slack was achieving full team adoption—its utility diminishes with even one team member's defection. However, once adopted by a team, the benefits—similar to the immediate relief anesthesia provides in surgery—are immediate and substantial.

**Challenges to Prevailing Beliefs**

The path from product development to rapid growth for Salesforce, like Slack, spanned roughly five years. Salesforce provided immediate benefits to its users primarily through its SaaS model, which encountered resistance from proponents of the then prevailing on-premise model.<sup>3</sup> To overcome this resistance, Salesforce invested in an aggressive and sustained marketing campaign, unlike Slack, which famously avoided such tactics.  Thus, while the perception of immediate benefit was similar, prevailing beliefs required additional effort for SalesForce that was not needed by Slack.

**Headwinds: Lack of immediacy along with challenges**

Another case, demand forecasting (also known as price optimization), faced challenges more akin to those of sterilization than anesthesia.  Price optimization started with two brothers, Ken and Tim Ouimet, who developed the idea of using machine learning algorithms to set product prices—and this was a tough sell. Retail pricing analysis had traditionally relied on experience and intuition when setting product prices. Convincing analysts and companies that an algorithm could replicate this expertise, and replicate it across an immense number of product, store, and time combinations, was met with resistance, to put it mildly. In order to overcome this resistance and build trust, elaborate “bake-offs”—competitions between humans and machines to achieve comparable revenue in similar sales regions—were conducted. These efforts required several software PhD scientists to run the algorithms across vast amounts of data in order to produce forecasts that not only matched, but often beat, those of the experienced analysts.  Yet, despite the results, these efforts did not always lead to a sales.  In fact, by 2005, the company was facing the possibility of a shutdown.  Luckily, at the end of the year, Khimetrics was purchased by SAP, which had enough resources and talent to sustain the development and growth of this product.  And this investment allowed SAP to attain the top spot in the industry.

**All Products Take Time for Adoption**

The preference for viral products is undeniable, offering a seemingly quicker path to rewards especially given that, the longer a product takes to be adopted, the riskier the investment becomes. Many products, despite significant investment and effort, never find their market—a phenomenon so common it's termed the "long tail" product. Occasionally, however, an idea emerges that requires time and effort to overcome resistance and obstacles and goes on to transform industries, define new markets, and even save lives.  And, like many stories, the seemingly instant success of many products in reality required time and effort prior to launch to create the value and pave the way for their period of rapid growth.
