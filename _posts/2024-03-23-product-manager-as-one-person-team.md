My father retired from the university, moved to the mountains, built a house, and declared himself a member of the "lead pencil club."  He spent the better part of his winter days reading and writing; for the latter, he *actually* used a pen, and sometimes an old typewriter.  He did not own a television, much less a computer, and I doubt he ever browsed the internet.  If he were alive today, artificial intelligence would have had no effect on him. 

But this is not true for the rest of us, especially those practicing the art of product management.  Advancements in computational systems with one or more abilities to perceive, learn, reason, and act in the world are astounding.  Companies that have not done so already are announcing plans for products and features based on machine learning or artificial intelligence.  And with the availability of generative models, engineers, designers, data analysts, and product managers are now able to automate many of our repetitive tasks allowing us to be more responsive and productive.

Given that, could a product manager become a one-person team?

A product manager can be anyone with a useful idea and a process to turn that idea into a product.  Presumably, an experienced engineer or technical product manager could leverage these tools to design, build, test, and iterate a working prototype into existence.  And further, as CEO of this product, the product manager could automate enough of the process to fit in marketing and sales and realize the rewards.

There is one thing missing though:  The team.  The engineers, designers, analysts, users, customers, managers, stakeholders, and product managers are all integral to the creation of great products.  In other words, there are many things missing.

Ask your chatbot to describe a problem that needs to be solved and see what you get.  In my experiments, no matter the question, I get an answer that I already know.  Why?  These tools are only able to use what they have been given; they are missing contact with the physical world that leads to new ideas.  It is this "bumping into things" that leads to creativity, intuition, perseverance and, when combined with a team, synergy.

As a single member team, I am the limit.  Just as the chatbot is limited to existing ideas, all my ideas come from others:  New ideas are truly rare.  But if I have been effective in anything, it is in contributing the building blocks of my thoughts and opinions to those of my colleagues which, when combined, serve to create a thing of value.

I do believe that it is possible for a talented product manager to leverage these advancements and go it alone.  But, like all things, there is a balance.  In most cases, one person will not replace a corporate body, all jobs will not go to one.  Instead, those with a solid understanding of real world work will become more productive and more accurate, and more will be accomplished.

My father lived his life unaffected by those things that affect me now.  But he was affected by the ideas, opinions, and rumors of his time.  As in old time, there is nothing new under the sun.
