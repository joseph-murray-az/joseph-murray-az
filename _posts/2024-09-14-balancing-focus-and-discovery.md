In product management, it is crucial to begin with a clear understanding of the problem to be solved.  However, throughout the project lifecycle--from the initial discovery through each subsequent iteration--new discoveries are often made, especially when dealing with a high number of unknowns, which is often the case when working on a new product using emerging technologies.  These discoveries can either reveal opportunities to accelerate development and enhance outcomes, or they can distract the team and potentially compromise the productâ€™s core purpose.  The product manager often bears the responsibility of deciding when to pursue a new discovery and when to refocus on the original goal.

**Why are new discoveries are so compelling?**

New discoveries highlight a natural tension that occurs between what needs to be done and what can be done.  Pursuing what can be done often feels like a gamble.  For example, if I need to display a message to a user, I may discover that I can use an LLM to generate a personalized message in place of static text.  But in the meantime, while I am tinkering with prompts and data, my team may be ready to release.  When pressure is added, say a big demo is scheduled for the afternoon, the risk increases.  Successfully personalizing the message may be a big hit with your audience, but failure could result in missing the demo altogether.  

**What role does intuition and desire for understanding play?**

While there is debate on the origin, whether transcendental or evolutionary, we all seem to have an inherent desire for understanding.  This desire drives us to invest in new discoveries, experiment with novel approaches, and connect new learning with existing knowledge--or sometimes even replace what we think we know.  

In this process, we rely on both intuition and analysis.  Intuition is an unconscious intelligence, that draws on accumulated experience and knowledge, and allows us to make quick decisions based on limited information.  Analysis, on the other hand, is a systematic and methodical approach, that relies on facts, data, and observable evidence, in order to examine and understand something.  While both are essential skills for product managers, intuition often takes precedence when dealing with new discoveries, especially under time constraints.

In new product development using emerging technologies, discoveries are likely to be made, and with limited time or data for extended analysis.  In such environments, the need to balance intention and purpose with exploration and discovery becomes urgent, thus these decisions rely heavily on intuition.

**What are some strategies for balancing purpose and exploration?**

Strategies that can be used include:

- Develop strong time management skills:  Be intentional with your time by planning activities and defining completion criteria
- Maintain context:  Ensure discovery activities align with the project goals and values
- Time-box activities:  Set a timer for discovery activities and move on when the time is up, regardless of completion status
- Document outcomes:  Write a story or one-pager to capture results and set aside ideas for future consideration
- Plan for larger changes:  If a discovery suggests significant changes, plan for implementation in later sprints or releases

**Looking beyond the goal**

While working on new products using emerging technologies is exciting, it often comes with pressure to deliver tangible results early and often.  As for all projects, goal setting, time management, and planning are necessary for success.  But when extra time can allow the pursuit of new discoveries that result in a deeper understanding of what is possible, that can expand the vision and definition of success, why not double down?
