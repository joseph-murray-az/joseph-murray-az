Great stories consist of a hero, the building of a conflict, a sudden realization or epiphany, followed by the change necessary for resolution.  The Odyssey illustrates this:  When Odysseus finds his wife and kingdom threatened by the suitors, disguised as a beggar, he realizes his adventures as a war hero did not prepare him as the strategist that he must become.  The techniques used to engage readers include the compression of time, elimination of irrelevant details, and amplification of events.

Though amplified, the gods and mythical creatures are founded in truth—and there are parallels between the hero’s journey and life experiences.  We may not be exposed to the song of the sirens, but we all experience temptations, though probably in more mundane forms like ice cream and chocolate bars (and other things found in bars).  Just as there are parallels between the story of Odysseus and real life, there are similar parallels between the stories told by founders and the daily work of product managers.  The stories are often nicely packaged; the daily work is often a mess. If you are reading articles and books on product management, then taking what you learned to the office, you may have noticed that the ideal often clashes with the real.

There are founders who have created a business of selling product management—in the form of books, courses, training, and ideas.  These ideas are often expressed as frameworks and acronyms, employing catchy phrases and metaphors that fit into an elevator pitch.  There are the best sellers like Lean and Inspired, just as before them there were the perennial 7 Habits, How to Influence, Total Quality, Patterns and more.  Some are rigorous and based on experience, real projects and products, successes as well as failures; some stories are well told.  And some are hollow.  When you read, get inspired, then frustrated, and yet press on to learn what did not work and why, you become just a bit wiser.  And those who remain standing can be described as either genius, in which case they may have something to sell, or jaded, in which case they may have some sage advice. In corporate America, it is a good skill to be able to recognize one from the other.

Real product management can be aptly described as “a liquid that fills in the spaces wherever needed and that changes from company to company and even from division to division."<sup>1</sup>  Imagine running across this as a job description!  At the very least, when each experience varies so much from the rest, it becomes difficult to create a story that is general much less universal.  And yet, there is some value in the reading.

The stories and frameworks serve as an ideal state which is not always supported by the organization.  For example, not all organizations use the three amigos approach of shared responsibility between the product manager, designer and engineering lead.  Not all organizations grant product managers "ownership" of a product and delegate accountability to the market to decide success.  Not all organizations even support product as a team or role; for many it is a variation of project manager.  And when I say not all, I really mean few.

But the ideal state does influence both the role and the organization and, even in the most confined role, there are always opportunities to practice the ideal state.  Product managers can usually find a way to gather customer feedback, whether by inviting themselves to sales and marketing calls, building features or using tools that allow the collection of user engagement data, talking to consultants and contractors who act as proxies for end users, or simply reading support tickets and negative reviews.  Sometimes you will find that the consultants are actually the users:  Who is to say that the on-premise consultants that install, test, and train others on the software are not the real users of the software?  There are many creative ways to approach and engage in those activities described as the ideal state.

Read the books and articles, take notes, try new ideas, abandon practices, throw out past processes, plan and measure, run on intuition and survive by turn of phrase!  There is nothing we can’t paper over with a slick presentation and a charismatic presence!  Dive in headfirst and be the first in line to signup for the latest trend!

But do what we really do: connect and support and help each other.
