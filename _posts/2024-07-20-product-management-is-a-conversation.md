title: Product management is a conversation

Product management in practice is a conversation which may take place in person or through a variety of media.  The forms of this conversation are varied and can be formal or informal.  But regardless, whether a formal product brief or presentation, or an informal chat or off-the-cuff response, a message that is clear, concise, coherent, and relevant reduces misunderstandings.  

**Why is this important?**

Misunderstandings, which can occur when the message is unclear, can lead to extensive problems.  Even when your message is wrong, if it is understood, it can be corrected.  But messages that are misunderstood, especially early in the process, are the root cause of inefficient product development.  Think about it:  Products that solve a problem but are buggy can be fixed; but products based on a misunderstanding of the problem cannot; and this flaw, which occurs during the conversation, can take years to sort out.  But we can make sure that our messages are understood by taking a cue from product development--by crafting our messages in prioritized increments.

**The value of prioritizing**

The idea of ruthless prioritization used for managing the backlog can also be applied to writing and speaking.  When working on a backlog, ruthless prioritization aims at eliminating low value and extraneous items and retaining only what is absolutely necessary to get the right product into the hands of the user as efficiently as possible.  In the best case, the resulting product should be simple, relevantly scoped, logically organized, and contain only the features necessary to solve the problem.  In other words, just like the ideal message, the product is clear, concise, coherent, and relevant.

The same process, with practice, can be applied to writing and speaking.  For example, when writing a product brief, it is common to introduce tangential ideas and include supporting documentation.  Ruthless prioritizing means that any sentence or phrase that does not directly clarify the problem to be solved should be cut.  This is more difficult to do in conversation, especially when responding off-the-cuff, where the tendency is to provide more detail than is needed.  To avoid this tendency, practice creating summary statements, which are much easier to follow.  The ability to summarize in conversation comes more naturally when time has already been invested in crafting concise documents.  Learn to replace your paragraph with a sentence, practice your elevator pitch!  

**The value of increments**

We talk a lot about moving fast in product development, and product development today using modern languages and infrastructure moves much more quickly than in the past.  But the real gains are created by our ability to deliver products directly to users in small increments.  In a sense, this is an illusion:  The time it takes to create all of the features delivered in one release, versus many small releases, is roughly the same but, in the latter case, users can see the progress as it occurs.  But this is not the only advantage, we are able to see if and how users engage with each feature which, in turn, allows us to prioritize productive efforts and eliminate waste, and this is how we are able to excel.

Concomitant to these smaller, more frequent deliveries, we converse in smaller and more frequent intervals as well, and our tools support this.  Consider the difference between an email exchange and a conversation in Slack or Teams--the latter makes the former seem sluggish and slow.  Email tends to be used for longer, more detailed correspondence and for this, it can be effective.  But to see a group conversation occur in real-time allows the progress towards understanding to be witnessed as it unfolds.  The key is to build this conversation using small increments which, despite their size, should also be clear, concise, coherent, and relevant (although occasional jokes or gifs are appreciated).  When properly executed, this means less waste too, especially as misunderstandings are uncovered, corrected, and the conversation advances the understanding of the product goal.

**And this is the art!**
  
In all cases, engaging in the conversation of product management is never easy.  Rare are those who are able to clearly communicate using both written and spoken words; rare are those who are able to consistently craft and deliver a clear message; and, even when we are faithful in our desire to achieve this end, our aim is rarely true.  But each iteration provides an opportunity to improve and, this building of experience and improving in our craft along the way, for those fully engaged, is the art of product management.
