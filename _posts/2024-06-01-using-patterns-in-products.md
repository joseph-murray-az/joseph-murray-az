Great products feel familiar yet are able to surprise.  To achieve this, the product manager can use patterns.  A pattern is any regularly repeated arrangement.  There are established patterns in software products, patterns for searches, sorting, paging, feeds.  For example, a common pattern used for paging on social media platforms is the continuous scroll--as the user approaches the bottom of the page, more content is loaded.  Patterns make your product feel familiar, reduce learning time, and eliminate the need for user manuals and other documentation.  

Patterns are used in the arts--in literature, painting, music--basically all disciplines use some form of pattern.  To take one, rhetoric, which is the study of language as means for persuasion, many rhetorical devices depend on patterns to persuade.  For example, the rhetorical device anaphora, which is the repetition of the same word or expression at the beginning of successive phrases, is used to emphasize, clarify, and facilitate understanding of the main thought, as in:  
	
>Great products feel familiar, great products are easy to understand, great products incorporate common patterns to achieve that end.
	
The structure of this sentence, by using repetition, helps the reader to more easily remember the main point and to understand what follows.

Rhetorical patterns can also be used to surprise.  As an example, another pattern, or perhaps antipattern, is called antanaclasis, which is the repetition of a word within a phrase in which the second occurrence utilizes a different and sometimes contrary meaning, as in:

>Good companies aim to be great, great companies aim to do good.
	
In this sentence, the turn at the end from *be* to *do* causes the reader pause, it is not expected.  This device is often used in jokes and humor, and products that use a disruptive pattern to surprise are, not surprisingly, fun and funny.

The innovative Chinese social shopping app Pin Duo Duo is an example of this practice.  Western online shopping apps, like Amazon and Walmart.com, have an established pattern for the search feature which is prevalently displayed at the top of every page.  But, in order to emphasize the "discovery" of products, Pin Duo Duo uses the main feed as the central feature, while burying the search bar off the edge of the menu.  This example is disruptive:  Although the familiar patterns of the search and feed features are used, the placement and emphasis of each is reversed.

Great ideas for products can come from anywhere, real life and the arts.  By looking for patterns, and finding opportunities to apply them, you can make your product both easier and more interesting to use, and the results can be both familiar and fun.
