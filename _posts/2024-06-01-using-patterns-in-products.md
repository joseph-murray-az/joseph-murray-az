Great products feel familiar yet are able to surprise.  To achieve this, the product manager can use patterns.  A pattern is any regularly repeated arrangement.  There are established patterns in software products, patterns for searches, sorting, paging, feeds.  For example, a common pattern used for paging on social media platforms is the continuous scroll--as the user approaches the bottom of the page, more content is loaded.  These patterns are useful, they make your product feel familiar, reduce learning time, and eliminate the need for user manuals and other documentation.  

Patterns are used in the arts--in literature, painting, music--basically all disciplines use some form of pattern.  For example, in rhetoric, which is the name for the study of language as means for persuasion, most rhetorical devices depend on patterns to facilitate understanding.  Take, for example, the rhetorical device anaphora, which is the repetition of the same word or expression at the beginning of successive phrases, clauses or sentences.  For example:  
	
>Great products feel familiar, great products are easy to understand, great products incorporate common patterns to achieve that end.
	
The structure of this sentence, by using repetition, helps the reader to more easily understand what follows.

Another pattern, or perhaps antipattern, is antanaclasis, which is the repetition of a word within a phrase or sentence in which the second occurrence utilizes a different and sometimes contrary meaning from the first.  This pattern can be used to surprise.  For example:

>Good companies aim to be great, great companies aim to do good.
	
In this sentence, the turn at the end from *be* to *do* causes the reader pause, it is not expected.  This device is often used in jokes and humor, and products that use a disruptive pattern to surprise are, perhaps surprisingly, often fun and funny.

The innovative Chinese social shopping app Pin Duo Duo is an example of this practice.  Western online shopping apps, like Amazon and Walmart.com, have an established pattern for the search feature which is prevalently displayed at the top of every page.  But, in order to emphasize the "discovery" of products, Pin Duo Duo uses the main feed as the central feature, while burying the search bar off the edge of the menu.  This example is disruptive:  Although the familiar patterns of the search and feed features are used, the placement and emphasis of each is reversed.

Great ideas for products can come from anywhere, real life and the arts.  By looking for patterns, and finding opportunities to apply them, you can make your product both easier and more interesting to use.  The results can be both familiar and fun.
