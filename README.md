# About this site

This site was created using Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages, and using GitHub actions.  I chose these technologies because the engineering teams I am currently working with are creating web products using Ruby on Rails, Git, GitHub, and related products and services.  

The creation of this project is helping me to become more versed in the technology and terms used in the office.  It was a bit more work to learn and setup but, now that I am over the hump, I am finding it easy to update, and to troubleshoot when needed.  

Thank you to those who created this foundation for people like me to use.
