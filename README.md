# A professional website

This is a professional website that consists of a home page, and about page, and a blog.  The focus of the blog is random thoughts on product management.

This project repository contains the markdown that is transformed to create the website by Jekyll, using the Cayman theme, hosted on GitHub pages.

The site configuration is contained in the _config.yml and the builds are run using GitHub actions.

The following is the structure of the repository:

* _includes - disclaimer and analytics
* _layouts - overrides for the pages in the Cayman project
* _posts - markdown pages that makeup the blog
* app - code samples (illustrations only)
* assets - overrides for the style sheets in the Cayman project

### Credits

I learned how to create this site by watching the LinkedIn videos from Ray Villalobos, for more information and links to videos, see: https://www.linkedin.com/in/planetoftheweb/.

Thank you to Ray and to those who created this foundation for people like me to use.
