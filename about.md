Joseph Murray, Senior Product Manager

### About me

Welcome to my site!  My name is Joseph Murray and I am a senior product manager.  My career has spanned three decades and, in that time, I have been a software engineer, quality engineer, project manager, program manager and, for the past eight years, product manager.

Of all of these roles, I find product management the most challenging and most fun.  I find myself outside of my comfort zone on most days.  Parts of the job play to my strengths:  I love to write, organize, collaborate, and produce.  Parts of the job are challenging, even on the best of days.  And all of the job has caused me to grow.

But most of all, I love to learn, and every product and feature that I am able to release provides an opportunity to discover what people value and what they do not.  This requires me to discover problems, formulate hypothesis, test assumptions, and define what it means to realize success.  This is product management.  And, in many ways, this is life.
